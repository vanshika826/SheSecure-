Tips to escape from different threats/situations:

Threat: Physical Assault in a Public place
Stay aware of your surroundings, park in well-lit areas, and have keys ready when approaching your car or run away as fast as you can or ask a female stranger for help. If threatened, make noise, attract attention, and head back to a populated area.

Threat: Unwanted Attention or Stalking
Change your route, go to a public place, and contact someone you trust. Inform authorities if stalking persists and consider obtaining a restraining order. Use emergency helpline numbers.

Threat: Kidnapping
Have a safety weapon such as pepper spray, a heavy object to attack. If you do not have anything at that moment, try hitting the person with anything you have be strong. Call police immediately or call any emergency service as soon as possible.

Threat: Home Invasion
Have a safe room with a lock, keep a phone in the bedroom, and know escape routes. If possible, quietly leave the house and seek help.

Threat: Workplace Harassment
Document incidents, report them to HR or a supervisor, and seek support from colleagues. If the situation persists, consider legal action and involve external authorities.
